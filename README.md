# Campus Key

Campus Key is an IOS application created by students, for students. 
The product goal of Campus Key and our team is to create the best possible 
college experience for students. The application will create a system in 
which students will use their student email to create an account. 
From there, students will be able to:

● Review various places on campus

● Review classes that they have taken

● Review entire faculties/departments

● Give tips and tricks for getting around campus

From there, both visitors and students of the campus will have access to a version
of the application which allows them to see the reviews/tips and tricks from
students. Also being able to view and use:

● Seeing where various supplies are sold

● New event schedules

● Get GPS navigation/direction around campus

This application will be combining the best that Yelp, various campus applications,
and RateMyProfessor has to offer. It will even be improving on some of those
features and creating a one-stop-shop for students to come and get familiarized
with their campus. With Campus Key, being a stereotypical, confused freshman will
be a thing of the past.
